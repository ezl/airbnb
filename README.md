# airbnb

show availability for multiple airbnb's side by side to make it easier to patch together a long stay in a city if there isn't a single place available for the duration you're looking for.

## Build Setup

```bash
# install dependencies
$ yarn install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:3000
$ yarn dev

# build for production and launch server
$ yarn build
$ yarn start

# generate static project
$ yarn generate
```
